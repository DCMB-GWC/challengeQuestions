    "- Are there parts that get repeated multiple times?\n",

    "\n",
    "3) Write up your code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Try it out on a friend!\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- Make sure you have a variable you set that is the word your friend is trying to guess. \n",
    "    - Ex: word = \"python\" -- you can manually change this word each time you want to play another game of hangman\n",
    "- You have to tell your friend how long the word is\n",
    "- When your friend guesses a correct letter, you have to add it in the correct place in the word\n",
    "- When your friend guesses an incorrect letter, you have to let them know\n",
    "- The game is over when all of the letters are guessed (or you can set a maximum number of turns your friend can take to guess the word)"
